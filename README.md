# Circuit Puzzle Game

This is my second project using Vue.js; it contains a program to randomly generate a puzzle involving grid of tiles, some of which can be rotated. To solve the puzzle, the tiles must be rotated in such a way that they create a path connecting the start and end points. The grid may also feature numbered portals, which will connect the circuit to the matching portal on the grid. The puzzle is randomly generated each time the page is loaded. The game can be played online [here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/circuit/).

Below are sample images of what a puzzle grid may look like upon loading the page and after being solved:
